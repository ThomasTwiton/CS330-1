	<p>The goal of this game is to get your mouse to the square as many times as you can before you are overwhelmed with all the balls! You can choose from 3 difficultys, see if you can take on Insane! You can click on the screen to make the balls reverse their direction. There are a few bugs that I will be working on, but have fun!</p>
