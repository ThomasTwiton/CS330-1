# Final Projects

Your final project must be written using the Flask application framework. It can be a project based around almost anything as long as it meets the following criteria in terms of the use of web2py.

### For a C
For a grade of a C you can create a blogging engine, by following the [Miguel Grinberg Flask Tutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)
 * parts 1 -- 12 (you can skip 11 on email)
 * This tutorial leads you step by step through building a microblog application using flask and associated libraries.



### For a B
For a grade of a B your project must incorporate the following.

* You must have at least three controllers  (Think python functions with @app.route decorators)
* You must have at least three views (Think templates)
* You must make use of some persistent data - something must be stored and accessed from the database. Using the DBAPI , SqlAlchemy or some other Python DB API.  No more than one table is required.
* You must have some type of form processing so that your application is interactive.
* Your program must use the bootstrap templates, and you must make an attempt to make it look aesthetically nice.

### For an A
To earn an A on the project you will need to go further.

* You must have at least three controllers (Think python functions with @app.route decorators)
* You must have at least three views (Think templates)
* You must use the SqlAlchemy plugin and create a database with 3-4 tables.  These tables should incorporate a one to many relationship in some way, or they may have a many to many relationship.  -- We'll look at this in class a couple days.
* You should deploy your project on Heroku, appengine, or some other free hosting site so that it is freely accessable and not on the Luther network.  -- We'll look at this in class next week.
* You should incorporate the WTForms module into your application for processing form data.  -- You can teach yourself this from the tutorial.
* You should provide a small AJAX API for some aspect of the project that you use in your web pages.  Or you may incorporate some other more advanced Flask Plugin that you OK with me.
* Your program must use the bootstrap templates, and you must make an attempt to make it look aesthetically nice.

You may work in teams of 2 on this project, unless you are doing the blogging application.
